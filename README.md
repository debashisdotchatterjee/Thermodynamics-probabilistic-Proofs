README for R Code Verifying the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics
Overview
This README provides an explanation and usage guide for two R scripts that verify the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics through simulation. The scripts generate insightful plots to visualize the relationships between internal energy, work, heat, and entropy over time.
